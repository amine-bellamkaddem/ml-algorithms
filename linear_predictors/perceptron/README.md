# The Perceptron Algorithm

This folder is linked to the Medium post **Linear Predictors - The Perceptron, From Theory to Algorithms**.

This is a Python implementation of the perceptron algorithm. It has been tested with `Python 3.9` and `3.10`.

The dependencies are: `Numpy`, `Matplotlib`, and `Scikit-learn`.

`Scikit-learn` is only used for loading and creating datasets.

### Docker
If you prefer using Docker, you can build and run the image using the following commands:

`docker build -t linear-predictor-perceptron .`

`docker run --rm linear-predictor-perceptron`

Please note that Matplotlib plots are not displayed if you are using Docker.
